editmoin (1.9.1-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Import package into bzr, branching from upstream trunk
    (https://code.launchpad.net/~niemeyer/editmoin/trunk). Drop debian/patches
    and apply them inline, since that's much more convenient for merging.
    Add Vcs-Bzr: to debian/control.
  * debian/control: Fix typo in description. (Closes: #459549)
  * Add editmoin.1: manpage, based on former README. Install it in setup.py.
    (Closes: #453682)
  * Remove debian/editmoin.README.debian, superseded by manpage.
  * editmoin: Use subprocess instead of os.system() to run the editor, to
    avoid issues with weird $EDITOR values.
  * editmoin: Fix crash when the first line starting with "@ " comes before
    the first line starting with "@@". (LP: #190081)

editmoin (1.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release to Debian. (Closes: #452946)
  * debian/patches/01_vim-modeline.patch: Add a vim modeline to automatically
    enable the moin.vim syntax file.
  * debian/patches/02_http_auth.patch:
    - Replace URLopener with FancyURLopener to make HTTP authentication
      actually work. Thanks to Soren Hansen for the patch.
  * Add editmoin.README.debian: Upstream tarball does not come with any
    documentation, take the http://labix.org/editmoin Moin source and mangle
    it a bit for readability.
