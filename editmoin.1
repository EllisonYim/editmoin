.SH NAME
editmoin \- Edit MoinMoin wiki pages in your favourite editor

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B editmoin 
http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/TestPage

.B editmoin 
-t SomeTemplate http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/TestPage

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B editmoin
allows you to edit Moin wiki pages with your preferred
editor. It means you can easily edit your pages, without the usual
limitations of most web browsers' text areas.

Its usage is simple and straightforward. Just provide moin's web page
url as the first parameter. For example:

.IP
editmoin http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/TestPage

.PP
You can also use the -t parameter, to inform a template
to base this page on. For example:

.IP
editmoin -t SomeTemplate http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/TestPage

.SH CHANGE SETTINGS

While you're editing a page you'll notice that a few settings are
available at the top of the page. These settings are preceded by a @
symbol, and are immediately followed by the page body. These settings
allow you to inform, for example, if you want subscribing users to be
notified of your changes, or provide a comment for your change. Their
functionality is simple, and their meaning, format, and usage should be
obvious to you.

.SH SELECTING YOUR EDITOR

The default editor is vi. If you want to use any other, just set the
.B EDITOR 
environment variable accordingly.

.SH SETTING YOUR MOIN ID

In remote times, authentication was done in moin using an ID, consisting
mostly of numbers.  Nowadays moin was improved to work with a more
traditional username/password scheme.  Even then, these IDs may still
be obtained after authentication, when the moin site sends your browser
a MOIN_ID cookie.

Unless you tell editmoin your moin IDs, you'll be editing pages
anonymously.  Setting moin IDs consists of changing a file named
.B ~/.moin_ids 
and inserting "url id" pairs in it. For example:

.IP
http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de 987654321.321.54321 
http://wiki.canonical.com
http://example.com/moin/moin.cgi 123456789.123.12345 

.PP
If the server needs Basic HTTP Authentication you can use something like:

.IP
https://user:password@example.com/moin/moin.cgi 123456789.123.12345

.PP
For using shortcuts (see below), and also for better control, defining
URLs without IDs in that file is valid.

.SH ALIASES
Besides using shortcuts, it's also possible to define URL aliases in
a file named 
.B ~/.moin_aliases\fR.
This file should contain lines with pairs of "alias translation". For
instance:

.IP
script http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/ScriptMarket

.PP
With this line present, one may execute a command like follows:

.IP
editmoin script/EditMoin

.PP
and get the expected result.

Notice that unlike shortcuts, aliases must match 
.B exactly
to be considered.  After the alias is translated, the resulting URL is
also processed for matching shortcuts as specified below.

.SH SHORTCUTS

Instead of using the whole URL, you may use a shortcut, which consists
of any substring of an URL contained in 
.B ~/.moin_ids\fR,
followed by a slash and an optional subpath. For instance:

.IP
editmoin canonical/FrontPage

.SH PROXIES

If you're behind a proxy, set the 
.B http_proxy
environment variable, as usual.

.SH BACKUPS

Editing a moin page may take several minutes, or even hours sometimes.
With this in mind, after you change some page it is saved in a file
named 
.B ~/.moin_lastedit
even before trying to commit it. This gives an extra protection
against casual problems. Note that this file is overwritten every time
a page is successfuly changed, so save it somewhere if you want to
keep it.
